     <div class="col">Aoi Todo is a tall young man who stands about the same height as Satoru Gojo.
                      He has a very heavy muscular build and relatively tan skin.
                      He has small black eyes and shoulder-length black hair that is almost always tied into bun.
                      Aoi prefers close quarters combat, normally relying on brute force to overpower his opponents rather than jujutsu.
                      Combined with his cursed technique,Boogie Woogie, Aoi's strength becomes even more difficult to deal with.
                      It allows him to exploit openings in his opponent's defense which allows him to land lethal strikes using his physical strength.

                      What is Boogie Woogie? Boogie Woogie activates when the user claps their hands together.
                      The technique switches the positions of the user and anything they desire that has above a certain amount of cursed energy.
                      The user can also switch things or people not including themselves.

  <br>
                    In his and Yuji's battle against Sukuna, Todo unveiled that he had replaced his missing hand with a vibraslap.
                    The modification changed the activation trigger of his Boogie Woogie.
                    now allows for 50 position swaps per second. This significant boost in capability produces a bewildering effect,
                    rendering the timing of attacks unpredictable.
