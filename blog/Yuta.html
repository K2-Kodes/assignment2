                      Copy innate technique that allows him to replicate another sorcerer's innate technique.
                      Rika is a cursed spirit that remains with Yuta after Rika Orimoto passed away.

<br>
                      What is Copy? While connected to Rika, Yuta can copy innate techniques and use them.
                      He can even use multiple different techniques that he's copied in quick succession.
                      The conditions under which he can copy a technique is: He has to have Rika eat a part of a sorcerer's body to gain a copy of a technique.
                      The more body parts Rika is stronger and easier it is to copy the technique, as it is easier to analyse the cursed energy.
                      For more complex cursed techniques, training is still required to use them.
