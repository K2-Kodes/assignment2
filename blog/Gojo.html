     <div class="col">Satoru Gojo is a very tall, lean, and muscular man in his late twenties who is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color
                      Satoru is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer,
                      the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years.
                      He has the extraordinary physical strength to fight against powerful curses without a problem.
<br>
<br>
                      What is Limitless? At the base level, Limitless is an innate technique which is derived from the Gojo family.
                      This technique grants its users nigh-absolute control over space through cursed energy manipulation at an atomic level,
                      resulting in multiple subsequent results and techniques within the overall ability.
                      With the manipulation of space as just the base level of the technique,
                      Limitless has three standard and one "non-standard" form beyond this.
  <br>
  <br>
                      What are the Six Eyes? Not much is known about the Six Eyes, but it is known that they play some role in the precise usage of the Limitless.
                      It has been stated that similar to Limitless, Six Eyes is also an Innate Technique inherited through the Gojo family.
                      The Six Eyes allows Satoru to reduce his cursed energy consumption from technique activation infinitesimally near to nothing,
                      and that he will never run out of cursed energy in a fight as a result.
                      It is uncertain whether this refers to the cost of the techniques themselves or the reduction of unnecessary loss for efficiency.
                      His use of "Maximum Cursed Energy Output" seems to imply the latter.
                      It is heavily implied that Six Eyes allows for the user to perceive the world in terms of mass, speed, energy, and so forth alongside its other effects.
